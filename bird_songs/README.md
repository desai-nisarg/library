[Birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds.


## Dataset Information

This dataset consists of songs and calls of multiple bird species (87 distinct labels). It was collected and shared for the [Neural Information Processing Scaled for Bioacoustics: NIPS4B](http://sabiod.univ-tln.fr/nips4b/challenge1.html).

686 audio files, with multiple labels per recording, recorded with a sampling rate of 44100. Recording length varies from just above 1 second to just above 5 seconds.
