Refer to the accompanying manuscript (Desai et al. 2021) for more details about the recording methods.\n",

However, this is not an exhaustive list of all the calls in the file and each file may contain multiple call-types from one or more callers. Other call-types later identified are listed in the 'Possible call types in the file' column. However, this too is not an exhaustive list as not all call-types could be properly identified. More research needs to be done in classifying chimpanzee vocal repertoire."
