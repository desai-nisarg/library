The [dog (Canis familiaris)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog) is a domesticated carnivore of the family [Canidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae). It is part of the [wolf-like canids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canina_(subtribe)), and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. 
This dataset was recorded by researchers Sophia Yin and Brenda McCowan during a three-month period from July - September 2000.

## Dataset information
The dataset consists of 693 recordings of dog barks from 10 adult dogs, ranging in age from 3 to 13. The recordings were made using a DCR VX2000 digital
video recorder and its built-in omni-directional microphone with a 48-kHz frequency response. All barks were digitized at a 16-bit, 48-kHz sampling rate, and audio levels were adjusted manually using the audiometer to prevent audio clipping. Dogs were recorded in three contexts: 

- a disturbance situation in which a stranger rang the doorbell
- an isolation situation in which the dog was locked outside or in a room isolated from its owner
- play situation in which either two dogs or a human and a dog played together
