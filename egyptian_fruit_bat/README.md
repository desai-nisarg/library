The Egyptian fruit bat or Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) is a species of megabat that is found in Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and the Indian subcontinent.

Egyptian fruit bats are social mammals which use rich vocal communication, and have been found to possess the capability of vocal learning. They are social animals who nearly exclusively interact with each other in the dark using versatile vocal skills. This makes them particularly interesting for bioacoustic research.

Egyptian fruit bats live in colonies of dozens to thousands and may live to the age of 25 or more.

## Dataset information

This dataset has been shared by Yossi Yovel et al. as part of the [An annotated dataset of Egyptian fruit bat vocalizations across varying contexts and during vocal ontogenyAn annotated dataset of Egyptian fruit bat vocalizations across varying contexts and during vocal ontogeny](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017143) paper.

The dataset includes almost 300,000 files, a few seconds each, containing social vocalizations and representing the complete vocal repertoire used by the bats. Around 90,000 files are annotated with details about the individuals involved in the vocal interactions, their behaviours and the context. Moreover, the data include the complete vocal ontogeny of pups, from birth to adulthood, in different conditions (e.g., isolated or in a group).

The full dataset is available for download [here](https://figshare.com/collections/An_annotated_dataset_of_Egyptian_fruit_bat_vocalizations_across_varying_contexts_and_during_vocal_ontogeny/3666502). We preprocess the annotated subset of the dataset to make it amenable to research using machine learning techniques. This notebook will run you through the preprocessing steps taken as well as outline how to download the preprocessed data.
