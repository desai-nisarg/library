# Giant otters

Giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis) are endemic to lakes and rivers in Amazonian rainforests and wetlands. Giant otters usually live in family groups with the alpha-couple and their offspring from different years, resulting in group sizes between three to nine individuals. This dataset was collected by researchers Christina A. S. Mumm and [Mirjam Knörnschild](http://mirjam-knoernschild.org/) from 2009-2011.

## Data Information

This dataset consists of 441 recordings among 22 distinct vocalization types. The recordings were captured with a directional microphone (Sennheiser, MKH 416-P48U3) connected to a digital audio recorder (Zoom H2 Handy Recorder; 48 or 96 kHz sampling rate, 24 bit depth resolution). Underwater calls were recorded with a hydrophone (RESON TC4013 Hydrophone, 1 Hz to 170 kHz), amplified by a charge amplifier (#42003, P48), connected to a second audio recorder (Zoom H2 Handy Recorder; 96 kHz sampling rate, 24 bit depth resolution).
