# zebra_finch

The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is a highly vocal social songbird that relies on a set of 11 call types to communicate different behavioral states, intents or needs. The dataset was collected by researcher Julie E. Elie between 2011 and 2014 at University of California Berkeley using birds bred in the colony of the [Theunissen Lab](https://github.com/theunissenlab). 

## Dataset information
The dataset consists of 3405 zebra finch calls classified across 11 call types. The database contains vocalizations both from adult and juvenile (around 30 days old) zebra finches. Additonal labels include name of individual making the vocalization and its age.

The researchers have shared that some discrepancies in the naming of files are known to exist and somewhat expected since all of the files were manually annotated.
