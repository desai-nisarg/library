The macaques inhabit ranges throughout Asia, North Africa, and Gibraltar. They are principally frugivorous (preferring fruit), although their diet also includes seeds, leaves, flowers, and tree bark. All macaque social groups are matriarchal, arranged around dominant females. Aside from humans (genus Homo), the macaques are the most widespread primate genus.


## Dataset information

This dataset has been shared as part of the [Distributed acoustic cues for caller identity in macaque vocalization
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4806230/) paper. It contains 7285 macaque coo calls from 8 individuals (4 males and 4 females).

The original dataset can be downloaded from [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.7f4p9). We offer a peprocessed version amenable to applying machine learning techniques. The 01_Data_Preprocessing notebook (TODO: link to it after merge) documents the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset.

The 02_TBD (TODO: link when ready) notebook demonstrates how to create a dataset from this data and how to perform speaker identification using a Deep Learning method. In the paper, on the same task, classical bioacoustic methods achieve a mean accuracy of 80%. The Deep Learning method, without extensive fine tuning, achieves an accuracy of XX%.
