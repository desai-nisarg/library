The [macaques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque) inhabit ranges throughout Asia, North Africa, and Gibraltar. They are principally frugivorous (preferring fruit), although their diet also includes seeds, leaves, flowers, and tree bark. All macaque social groups are matriarchal, arranged around dominant females. Aside from humans (genus Homo), the macaques are the most widespread primate genus.


## Dataset information

This dataset contains 7285 macaque coo calls from 8 individuals (4 males and 4 females) with labels at the individual level. 5756 vocalizations have been recorded with a sampling rate of 24414 Hz and 1529 with a sampling rate of 44100 Hz. The duration of wav files varies from 896 frames to 37308 frames (0.04s to 1.69s).

Data is available for download from Internet Archive as [a single zip file](https://archive.org/details/macaques). This is a version of the dataset that has been peprocessed by us to facilitate the application of machine learning techniques. The preprocessing steps that have been taken are documented in the 99_Data_Preprocessing notebook. The instructions for the download of the dataset and for constructing datasets for training PyTorch deep learning models are provided in the 01_Download_The_Data_And_Construct_Dataloaders notebook.

This dataset has been collected and shared by shared as part Makoto Fukushima, Alex M. Doyle, Matthew
P. Mullarkey, Mortimer Mishkin and Bruno B. Averbeck under the [Distributed acoustic cues for caller identity in macaque vocalization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4806230/) paper.
